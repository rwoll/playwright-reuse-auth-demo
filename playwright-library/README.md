## Install Deps

```
$ npm i
```

## Manually Perform Login/MFA

Log in to your site and complete the MFA flow:

```
$ npm run login
```

Once you're authenticated, close the browser. This will save `auth.json` for the next step to use.

## Run Your Scripts

You can now run and observe you are already authenticated! You can run this repeatedly without logging in again!

```
$ npm start
```
